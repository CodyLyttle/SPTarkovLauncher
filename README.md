# SPTarkovLauncher
A simple tool for single-player Tarkov, designed to run both the launcher & server with a single click.

## How it works
- Checks for 'Aki.Launcher' & 'Aki.Server' processes, starting them if necessary.
- Focuses the new or existing launcher window.

## Installation
1) Download the latest release.
2) Place the .exe file into your SPTarkov directory, alongside 'Aki.Launcher.exe' & 'Aki.Server.exe'.

## Running the program
Simply run the application from the SPTarkov directory, or better yet, pin it to the start menu or taskbar for quick access.
